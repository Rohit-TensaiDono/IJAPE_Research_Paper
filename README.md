# Smart Home ADL Classification

## Overview

This repository presents a novel method for the classification of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) by leveraging Smart Meter and Smart Switch data in a synergistic approach. The integration of these Internet of Things (IoT) devices aims to enhance the precision and granularity of ADL classification, with a specific focus on intrusive loads within smart homes.

## Motivation

The system is designed to address the growing need for efficient energy management and informed decision-making within smart homes. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in load monitoring, energy management systems, and prepaid smart energy meter monitoring, our methodology incorporates machine learning techniques to analyze data streams from both Smart Meter and Smart Switch devices.

## Key Features

- **Data Integration:** Combines data from Smart Meter and Smart Switch for a comprehensive understanding of energy consumption patterns.
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to classify diverse ADL scenarios.
- **Adaptability and Robustness:** Evaluated under various usage patterns and scenarios, demonstrating suitability for different household environments.




## Related Work

The research is grounded in a comprehensive review of related literature, including studies on prepaid smart energy meter monitoring, energy reduction in building energy management systems, multi-agent systems for controlling smart grids, and non-intrusive load disaggregation solutions. The design also considers aspects such as mobile communication for prepaid meters, remote detection of malfunctional smart meters, and user acceptance of IoT-based smart meters.
